/**
 * @Component annotation is added to the class, so that when Spring framework will scan for the components, this class will be treated as component.
 * @Component annotation can be applied only to the class and itâ€™s retention policy is Runtime. If you are not not familiar with Annotations retention policy,
 * I would suggest you to read java annotations tutorial.
 * @Autowired annotation is used to let Spring know that autowiring is required. This can be applied to field, constructor and methods.
 * This annotation allows us to implement constructor-based, field-based or method-based dependency injection in our components.
 * For our example, I am using method-based dependency injection. You can uncomment the constructor method to switch to constructor based dependency injection.
